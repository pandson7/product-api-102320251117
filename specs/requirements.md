# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a Product API system that provides RESTful access to product specifications stored in a DynamoDB database. The system will support flexible JSON schemas for product data and include sample data for testing and demonstration purposes.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Product Data Retrieval
**User Story:** As an API consumer, I want to retrieve product information via REST endpoints, so that I can access product specifications in my applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN a client makes a GET request to /products THE SYSTEM SHALL return a list of all products in JSON format
2. WHEN a client makes a GET request to /products/{id} THE SYSTEM SHALL return the specific product details for the given ID
3. WHEN a client requests a non-existent product ID THE SYSTEM SHALL return a 404 error with appropriate error message
4. WHEN the database is unavailable THE SYSTEM SHALL return a 500 error with appropriate error message

### Requirement 2: Product Data Storage
**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want product data stored in a scalable NoSQL database, so that I can handle flexible product schemas and high throughput.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN product data is stored THE SYSTEM SHALL use DynamoDB as the primary database
2. WHEN storing product information THE SYSTEM SHALL support flexible JSON schemas for different product types
3. WHEN querying products THE SYSTEM SHALL use efficient indexing for fast retrieval
4. WHEN the system starts THE SYSTEM SHALL have sample product data pre-loaded for testing

### Requirement 3: API Gateway Integration
**User Story:** As a developer, I want a managed API gateway, so that I can have reliable endpoint management and monitoring.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN clients access the API THE SYSTEM SHALL route requests through AWS API Gateway
2. WHEN API requests are made THE SYSTEM SHALL implement proper CORS headers for web applications
3. WHEN errors occur THE SYSTEM SHALL return standardized HTTP status codes and error messages
4. WHEN requests are processed THE SYSTEM SHALL log API usage for monitoring

### Requirement 4: Sample Data Management
**User Story:** As a developer, I want pre-populated sample data, so that I can test the API functionality immediately after deployment.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN the system is deployed THE SYSTEM SHALL automatically populate the database with sample product data
2. WHEN sample data is created THE SYSTEM SHALL include diverse product categories and attributes
3. WHEN sample data is accessed THE SYSTEM SHALL demonstrate the flexible schema capabilities
4. WHEN testing the API THE SYSTEM SHALL provide at least 10 sample products with varied attributes

### Requirement 5: Data Validation and Error Handling
**User Story:** As an API consumer, I want proper error handling and validation, so that I can handle edge cases gracefully in my applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN invalid requests are made THE SYSTEM SHALL return appropriate HTTP status codes (400, 404, 500)
2. WHEN validation errors occur THE SYSTEM SHALL provide clear error messages in JSON format
3. WHEN database operations fail THE SYSTEM SHALL handle exceptions gracefully
4. WHEN rate limits are exceeded THE SYSTEM SHALL return 429 status code with retry information
